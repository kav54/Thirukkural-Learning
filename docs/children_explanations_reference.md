## Virtue (அறத்துப்பால்)

### Chapter 1: கடவுள் வாழ்த்து
**English:** The Praise of God

**Kural 1:**  
Just like 'A' is the first letter you learn in school, God is the beginning of everything in this world! When you start learning, you begin with 'A'. Similarly, everything in the universe starts with God.

**Kural 2:**  
Learning is wonderful, but it's even more special when we remember to thank God! It's like learning to ride a bike - it's fun, but even better when you share your joy with someone who cares about you.

**Kural 3:**  
When we think about God and remember His goodness, we become happy and strong! It's like having a superhero friend who always helps you do your best.
